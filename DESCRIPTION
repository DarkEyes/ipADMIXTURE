Description: A data clustering package based on admixture ratios (Q matrix) of population structure. The framework is based on iterative prunning procedure that performs data clustering by splitting a given population into subclusters until meeting the condition of stopping criteria the same as ipPCA, iNJclust, and IPCAP frameworks. The package also provindes a function to retrieve phylogeny tree that construct a neighbor-joining tree based on a similar matrix between clusters. By given multiple Q matrices with varrying a number of ancestors (K), the framework define a similar value between clusters i,j as a minimum number K* that makes majority of members of two clusters are in the different clusters. This K* reflexes a minimum number of ancestors we need to splitting cluster i,j into different clusters if we assign K* clusters based on maximum admixture ratio of individuals.
